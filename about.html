                <p>Hello! We are the Desi European(s).</p>
                <p>Our story began when we moved from India to Europe 6 years ago. We found ourself in a world of cobblestone streets, quiet Sundays, and sourdough bread that was harder than we were used to.</p>
                <p>But we also found beauty. We found that Italian hospitality rivals ours. We found that German precision brings a strange peace. And we found that one can always find good chai if they look hard enough (or may be not :).</p>
                <p>This blog is my attempt to bridge these two worlds. To show you Europe not just as a tourist destination, but as a home.</p>
                <p>We started our adventure in India, but life (and curiosity) led us to Europe, which we've called home for years. This blog, “Desi European,” is about blending the best of both worlds: our Indian roots and our passion for European exploration!</p>
                <p>Whether you're dreaming of your first European trip or searching for family travel hacks, we hope our stories inspire and help you travel farther, deeper, and with a little more joy.</p>
