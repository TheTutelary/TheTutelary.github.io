                <p>Hello! We are the Desi European(s).</p>
                <p>Our story began when we moved from India to Sweden six years ago. We suddenly found ourselves in a world of fika breaks, "Lagom" living, and winters that were much darker (and colder!) than we were used to.</p>
                <p>But in the quiet of the North, we found a different kind of beauty. We discovered that Swedish efficiency brings a strange peace, yet the warmth of a Mediterranean summer can still rival the hospitality back home. We’ve learned that while the sourdough might be crustier and the Sundays quieter, you can always find a good cup of chai if you look hard enough—though it usually comes with a side of cardamom buns now!</p>
                <p>This blog is our attempt to bridge these two worlds. We want to show you Europe not just as a collection of tourist spots, but as a home. From navigating family life in Scandinavia to wandering through the hidden corners of the continent, "Desi European" is about blending our Indian roots with our passion for European exploration.</p>
                <p>Whether you’re dreaming of your first trip or looking for practical family travel hacks, we hope our stories inspire you to travel farther, deeper, and with a little more joy.</p>
