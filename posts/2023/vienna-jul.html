                <p> This Vienna adventure is part of our 21-day Central Eastern adventure. We flew into Vienna,
                    spent 3 days days exploring the city, moved to Bratislava, hired and car and carried on a journey
                    which was to bring, happyness, sorrow and much adventure as we discovered.

                    Vienna didn’t just meet our expectations, it rekindled our sense of wonder as travelers and parents.
                    Every cobblestone and cafe felt like stepping into history, and into a new adventure for our family.
                    I remember this as teh city with the famous chess opening while it had to offer so much more.</p>



                <h2>Inner Stadt and the Schönbrunn Palace </h2>
                <p>Our Vienna voyage took us to some of the city’s most iconic landmarks. From the majestic Schönbrunn
                    Palace
                    to the historic Innere Stadt, every corner of Vienna seemed to whisper tales from the past.
                    And while Bollywood hasn’t showcased Vienna as much as Spain, the city’s charm is undeniable.
                    Our Bollywood-loving hearts couldn’t help but imagine a romantic song sequence in the backdrop of
                    St. Stephen’s Cathedral!</p>

                <p>During our stay, we delved deep into Vienna’s rich tapestry of history, which is influenced by
                    its position as the former head of the Habsburg Empire. The city’s Baroque streetscapes and imperial
                    palaces are a testament to its glorious past. And of course, we couldn’t resist indulging in some
                    lassic Viennese dishes. Sachertorte, anyone?</p>

                <h2>Café Culture</h2>
                <p>Zagrebians take their coffee more seriously than anyone I've met in Europe, and I live in
                    Scandinavia. The ritual of sitting in a café for hours — not working, not meeting anyone, just
                    sitting — is called "špica" and it's practically a civic duty. On a Saturday morning, the entire
                    city seems to be drinking espresso in the sun. As someone from a culture built on chai and
                    conversation, this felt deeply right.</p>

                <h2>Dolac Market</h2>
                <p>The Dolac farmers' market sits above the main square like a red-umbrella-covered crown. Fresh
                    produce, cheese, cured meats, and flowers — all from the Croatian countryside. I bought lavender
                    honey and a chunk of Paški sir cheese, and ate them on a bench overlooking the city. Simple.
                    Perfect.</p>
