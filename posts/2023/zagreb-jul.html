            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Everyone goes to Dubrovnik. Everyone forgets Zagreb. And Zagreb, to its credit, doesn't seem to mind.
                    The Croatian capital has the energy of a city that's happy to be discovered but isn't going to beg
                    for attention. It reminded me of that one friend who's quietly the most interesting person in the
                    room.</p>

                <p>Five days in July, when the streets hum with outdoor cafés and the evening light turns the Upper Town
                    golden. Zagreb showed me a Central Europe I hadn't expected — warm, unpretentious, and surprisingly
                    affordable.</p>

                <h2>Upper Town & Lower Town</h2>
                <p>Zagreb is a city of two halves, connected by a funicular that holds about twelve people and costs
                    less than a coffee. The Upper Town (Gornji Grad) is medieval, quiet, and home to St. Mark's Church
                    with its iconic tiled roof. The Lower Town is Habsburg grandeur — wide boulevards, green parks, and
                    the kind of architecture that makes you want to sit and stare.</p>

                <h2>Café Culture</h2>
                <p>Zagrebians take their coffee more seriously than anyone I've met in Europe, and I live in
                    Scandinavia. The ritual of sitting in a café for hours — not working, not meeting anyone, just
                    sitting — is called "špica" and it's practically a civic duty. On a Saturday morning, the entire
                    city seems to be drinking espresso in the sun. As someone from a culture built on chai and
                    conversation, this felt deeply right.</p>

                <h2>Dolac Market</h2>
                <p>The Dolac farmers' market sits above the main square like a red-umbrella-covered crown. Fresh
                    produce, cheese, cured meats, and flowers — all from the Croatian countryside. I bought lavender
                    honey and a chunk of Paški sir cheese, and ate them on a bench overlooking the city. Simple.
                    Perfect.</p>
