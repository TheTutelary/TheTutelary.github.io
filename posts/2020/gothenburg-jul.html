            <div class="article-content">
                <p>There's something quietly radical about a city that doesn't try too hard. Gothenburg sits on Sweden's
                    west coast like it has all the time in the world — which, in the endless summer light of July, it
                    very nearly does.</p>

                <p>This wasn't my first Swedish summer, but it was the first time I left Stockholm to explore the
                    country's second city. And what I found was a place that felt less polished, more lived-in, and
                    somehow more honest.</p>

                <h2>The Archipelago</h2>
                <p>The southern archipelago is reachable by tram and ferry — yes, your regular transit card works. The
                    islands are car-free, wind-swept, and dotted with red wooden houses. I spent an afternoon on Styrsö
                    doing absolutely nothing, which felt like the most Swedish thing I'd ever done.</p>

                <h2>Haga & Fika Culture</h2>
                <p>The cobblestoned Haga district is where Gothenburg wears its coziest face. Giant cinnamon buns the
                    size of your head, vintage shops, and the kind of cafés where people sit for hours without anyone
                    rushing them. Coming from a culture where hospitality means endless refills of chai, I felt right at
                    home.</p>

                <h2>The Fish Market</h2>
                <p>Feskekôrka — literally "Fish Church" — is a market built in the shape of a Gothic church. The irony
                    is not lost. The seafood here is extraordinary: fresh shrimp piled on toast, smoked mackerel, and
                    fish soup that rivals anything on the Mediterranean coast.</p>
