            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Prague is one of those cities where you round a corner and genuinely gasp. Not the polite, Instagram
                    gasp — the real one, where your breath catches and you stand there like an idiot blocking pedestrian
                    traffic. It happened to me at least four times in five days.</p>

                <p>I came in June, when the days are long and the beer gardens are full, and the golden light on the
                    baroque facades makes everything look like a fairy tale written by someone with excellent taste.</p>

                <h2>Charles Bridge Before Breakfast</h2>
                <p>The secret to Charles Bridge is simple: go before 7am. At that hour, it belongs to joggers,
                    photographers, and a few people who clearly haven't been to bed yet. The statues loom above you, the
                    Vltava flows below, and Prague Castle catches the first light. It's theatrical in a way that reminds
                    me of the ghats at sunrise.</p>

                <h2>Beer Culture</h2>
                <p>The Czech Republic drinks more beer per capita than anywhere else on Earth. And once you try a
                    properly poured Pilsner Urquell in a wood-panelled pub that's been serving since the 1400s, you
                    understand why. Beer here isn't a drink — it's a philosophy. And at prices that would make a
                    Scandinavian weep.</p>

                <h2>Vyšehrad & the Quiet Side</h2>
                <p>Everyone goes to Prague Castle. Far fewer make it to Vyšehrad, the ancient fortress on the south side
                    — and that's precisely why you should go. The views of the river are better, the gardens are
                    peaceful, and the cemetery is where Dvořák and Smetana rest. It's Prague without the performance.
