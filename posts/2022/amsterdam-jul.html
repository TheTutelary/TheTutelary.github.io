            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Amsterdam is a city that shouldn't work. It's built on water, run on bicycles, and held together by
                    an attitude of cheerful pragmatism that would make any Indian bureaucrat faint. And yet it works
                    beautifully — a flat, canal-laced miracle of urban planning and controlled chaos.</p>

                <p>Seven days gave me enough time to get past the tourist centre and into the neighbourhoods where
                    Amsterdam actually lives. De Pijp, Jordaan, Amsterdam-Noord — each one a different city wearing the
                    same name.</p>

                <h2>The Bike Revolution</h2>
                <p>You haven't known fear until you've tried to cycle in Amsterdam as a beginner. The locals move
                    through traffic like water through a sieve — fluid, inevitable, and completely indifferent to your
                    existence. By day three, I stopped being terrified and started being exhilarated. By day five, I was
                    ringing my bell at tourists with the best of them.</p>

                <h2>The Rijksmuseum & Vermeer</h2>
                <p>I'm not going to pretend I understood every painting. But standing in front of Vermeer's "Milkmaid" —
                    that quiet domestic scene of someone pouring milk with absolute concentration — I felt a strange
                    recognition. It could have been any kitchen in any Indian home. Art that crosses centuries and
                    continents in a single glance.</p>

                <h2>De Pijp & Albert Cuyp Market</h2>
                <p>If you want to understand modern Amsterdam, skip the centre and go to De Pijp. The Albert Cuyp Market
                    is a glorious mess of Surinamese roti, Dutch herring, Turkish kebabs, and Indonesian rijsttafel —
                    all within a hundred metres. For a desi, it feels like proof that multiculturalism actually works
                    when people are hungry enough.</p>
