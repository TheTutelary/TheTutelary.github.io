                <p>After months of Swedish darkness, landing in Goa feels like someone turned the saturation dial to
                    maximum. The heat hits you first — thick, salty, unapologetic. Then the colours: the impossible blue
                    of the Arabian Sea, the crumbling ochre of Portuguese churches, the green of palm trees that look
                    photoshopped but aren't.</p>

                <p>Eleven days in December. Enough time to slow down to Goa speed, which is approximately one-tenth of
                    any other speed you've ever lived at.</p>

                <h2>Old Goa & the Portuguese Ghost</h2>
                <p>Walking through Old Goa's basilicas and cathedrals is a strange experience for a desi who now lives
                    in Europe. Here is European architecture — baroque, ornate, grand — but set in tropical heat,
                    surrounded by palm trees, reclaimed by vines. It's a collision of worlds that produced something
                    entirely unique. The Basilica of Bom Jesus feels like a European cathedral that went on holiday and
                    never came back.</p>

                <h2>Anjuna to Palolem</h2>
                <p>North Goa and South Goa are different countries that share a border. Anjuna has the markets, the
                    noise, the scene. Palolem has the crescent beach, the silence, the dolphins at dawn. I spent time in
                    both, and the contrast is as stark as Stockholm versus a Swedish countryside village.</p>

                <h2>The Food</h2>
                <p>Goan food is what happens when Indian spices meet Portuguese technique. Fish curry rice is the
                    foundation — tangy, coconut-rich, with a heat that builds slowly. Prawn balchão, chorizo pav,
                    bebinca for dessert. And feni, the cashew spirit that tastes like Goa distilled into a glass.</p>
