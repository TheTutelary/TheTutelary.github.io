            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Florence is the kind of city that makes you feel uncultured and deeply cultured at the same time.
                    Every corner is a masterpiece, every piazza a stage. For someone who grew up surrounded by the
                    intricate carvings of Indian temples, the Renaissance felt less foreign and more like a conversation
                    across centuries.</p>

                <p>I arrived in April, when the Tuscan hills were turning impossibly green and the wisteria was dripping
                    from every wall. Five days. Not enough, but just enough to fall in love.</p>

                <h2>The Duomo at Dawn</h2>
                <p>Everyone photographs the Duomo, but few wake up early enough to see it without the crowds. At 6:30am,
                    the marble glows in a light that Brunelleschi himself must have designed the dome to catch. I stood
                    there with a cornetto and a cappuccino and understood, for the first time, why people move here and
                    never leave.</p>

                <h2>Oltrarno & the Artisans</h2>
                <p>Cross the Ponte Vecchio and you enter Oltrarno — the "other side of the Arno" — where Florence is
                    less museum and more neighbourhood. Here, leather workshops still operate the way they have for
                    generations, and trattorias serve ribollita that tastes like someone's grandmother made it, because
                    someone's grandmother probably did.</p>

                <h2>The Gelato Situation</h2>
                <p>I need to be honest: Florentine gelato has ruined me. Specifically, the pistachio at Vivoli. Every
                    gelato I've had since is just a pale imitation. This is not a review — it's a warning.</p>
