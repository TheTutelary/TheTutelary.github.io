            <div class="article-content">
                <p>I'll admit it: I had to Google Sozopol before I went. Bulgaria's Black Sea coast doesn't feature in
                    the typical European travel narrative, which is exactly why it charmed me. Sozopol is an ancient
                    fishing town — genuinely ancient, as in founded by the Greeks in 610 BC — perched on a rocky
                    peninsula, with the kind of unspoilt beauty that the rest of the Mediterranean lost decades ago.</p>

                <p>Eight days in July. Sun, sea, grilled fish, and the pleasant surprise of discovering a place that
                    hasn't yet been Instagram-optimized into blandness.</p>

                <h2>The Old Town</h2>
                <p>Sozopol's old town is a maze of narrow cobblestone streets lined with wooden houses from the 18th and
                    19th centuries. The upper floors jut out over the streets in a style that reminded me of the old
                    quarters in Varanasi — organic, lived-in architecture that was never designed but somehow has
                    perfect proportions. Bougainvillea cascades from every balcony, and cats own every corner.</p>

                <h2>Beach Life, Bulgarian Style</h2>
                <p>The beaches here are divided into "paid" (with loungers and umbrellas) and "free" (bring your own
                    towel and claim your spot). I preferred the wilder beaches south of town — Kavatsi and Alepu — where
                    the sand dunes are backed by nature reserves and the water is the cleanest I've swum in since...
                    well, ever. The Black Sea is warm, calm, and surprisingly clear.</p>

                <h2>The Food Revelation</h2>
                <p>Bulgarian food was the biggest surprise of the trip. Shopska salad with the thickest, creamiest white
                    cheese. Grilled sprats straight from the morning catch. Banitsa pastry for breakfast. And the
                    yoghurt — there's a reason Bulgaria has its own Lactobacillus species. The food is honest, generous,
                    and costs a fraction of Western European prices. I ate like a king for what I'd spend on a sandwich
                    in Stockholm.</p>
