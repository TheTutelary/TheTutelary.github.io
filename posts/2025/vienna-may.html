            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Vienna is a city that has elevated leisure to an art form. The Viennese don't hurry, they don't
                    multitask, and they certainly don't take their coffee to go. In a world obsessed with productivity,
                    Vienna feels like a gentle, well-dressed rebellion — which, for someone coming from the Swedish
                    efficiency bubble, was exactly what I needed.</p>

                <p>Five days in late May, when the city's parks are in full bloom and the outdoor Heurigen (wine
                    taverns) are opening for the season. Vienna at this time of year is golden, warm, and impossibly
                    romantic — even if you're there alone.</p>

                <h2>The Coffee House as Philosophy</h2>
                <p>A Viennese coffee house is not a café. It's a living room, a library, and a debating society rolled
                    into one, where you can sit for three hours over a single Melange and nobody will ask you to leave.
                    I spent mornings at Café Central, where Trotsky reportedly played chess, reading newspapers on those
                    wonderful wooden racks. The marble tables, the chandeliers, the waiters who manage to be
                    simultaneously attentive and completely indifferent — it's performance art.</p>

                <h2>Schönbrunn & Imperial Excess</h2>
                <p>Coming from India, I thought I knew imperial excess. Then I walked through Schönbrunn Palace's 1,441
                    rooms (okay, the tourist route covers 40) and realised the Habsburgs were playing the same game as
                    the Mughals — just with different materials. Yellow facades instead of red sandstone, chandeliers
                    instead of jharokhas, but the same fundamental message: we are very, very powerful.</p>

                <h2>The Naschmarkt</h2>
                <p>Vienna's main market stretches along the Wienzeile like an edible rainbow. Turkish delis next to
                    Austrian cheese stalls, Vietnamese pho places beside Sachertorte vendors. I found a stall selling
                    Kashmiri saffron and spent ten minutes discussing quality with the owner in a mix of Hindi and
                    German. The world is smaller than we think.</p>
