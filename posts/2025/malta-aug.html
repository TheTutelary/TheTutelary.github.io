            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Malta is what happens when every civilisation in Mediterranean history fights over the same tiny
                    island for three thousand years: you get a place that's part North African, part Italian, part
                    British, and entirely itself. Valletta's golden limestone glows in the August sun like the whole
                    city is made of fossilized honey, and the narrow streets echo with a language that sounds like
                    Arabic spoken with Italian enthusiasm.</p>

                <p>Five days in August. Hot — properly, seriously hot — but the azure sea is never more than ten minutes
                    away, and the gelato situation is excellent.</p>

                <h2>Valletta</h2>
                <p>The capital is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in its entirety, which makes sense when you see it. Built
                    by the Knights of St. John in the 16th century, it's a fortress-city of honey-coloured stone,
                    baroque churches, and balconies painted in green, red, and blue. It's astonishingly walkable — you
                    can cross the entire city in twenty minutes — but I spent hours in its streets, constantly
                    distracted by some new architectural detail or a view of the Grand Harbour that demanded five
                    minutes of staring.</p>

                <h2>The Three Cities</h2>
                <p>Across the harbour from Valletta sit the Three Cities — Vittoriosa, Senglea, and Cospicua — which are
                    older, quieter, and feel like the Malta the tourists haven't found yet. Narrow alleys, fishermen
                    mending nets, and fortress walls that have repelled everything from Ottomans to Luftwaffe. It
                    reminded me of the old walled cities in Rajasthan — places where history isn't preserved; it's just
                    still happening.</p>

                <h2>Pastizzi & Ftira</h2>
                <p>Maltese food is its own category. Pastizzi — diamond-shaped pastries filled with ricotta or mushy
                    peas — cost 50 cents and are essentially the national street food. Ftira is the Maltese answer to
                    pizza, but on sourdough-style bread with tomatoes, capers, olives, and tuna. Simple, ancient
                    flavours that reminded me that the best food is often the cheapest.</p>
