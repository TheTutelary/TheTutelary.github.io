            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Brussels has a reputation problem. Everyone passes through it — it's the capital of the EU, after all
                    — but few people actually stay. This is a mistake. Nine December days showed me a city of
                    extraordinary contradictions: Art Nouveau next to brutalist concrete, Michelin-starred restaurants
                    next to friteries serving fries in paper cones, and a population that somehow maintains three
                    official languages while collectively agreeing that beer is the only language that matters.</p>

                <p>December in Brussels means Christmas markets, mulled wine, and the Grand Place lit up like a baroque
                    fever dream. It also means rain, grey skies, and the kind of damp cold that makes you understand why
                    Belgian chocolate exists — as medicine for the weather.</p>

                <h2>The Grand Place</h2>
                <p>The Grand Place is not a square — it's a statement. Surrounded by ornate guild houses covered in gold
                    leaf, it's regularly voted the most beautiful square in Europe, and the competition isn't close. At
                    night during December, it's illuminated by a light show that reflects off the gilded facades and
                    makes the whole space shimmer. I've seen grand squares from Jaipur to Prague, and this one genuinely
                    took my breath away.</p>

                <h2>Beer Culture</h2>
                <p>Belgium has more beer varieties per capita than anywhere on earth: over 1,500 distinct beers.
                    Trappist ales brewed by actual monks. Lambics fermented with wild yeast. Cherry krieks that taste
                    like dessert. I visited Delirium Café, which holds the Guinness record for most beers available
                    (over 2,000), and spent an evening working through a carefully curated flight. It was educational.
                    It was also very effective.</p>

                <h2>The Chocolate Situation</h2>
                <p>Belgian chocolate is not the chocolate you know. Entering a place like Pierre Marcolini or Laurent
                    Gerbaud is entering a different universe of cacao — single-origin ganaches, pralines filled with
                    spiced cardamom, dark chocolate with Indian black pepper. When Belgian chocolatiers use desi spices,
                    something magical happens. I brought back two kilos. It lasted four days.</p>
