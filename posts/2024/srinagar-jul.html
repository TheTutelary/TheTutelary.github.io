            <div class="article-content">
                <p>They call Kashmir "Paradise on Earth," and usually when a place comes with a tagline that ambitious,
                    you prepare for disappointment. Not this time. Srinagar delivered. The Himalayas rising beyond Dal
                    Lake, the shikaras gliding through lotus-covered water, the air so clean it felt medicinal after
                    years in European cities — it was almost too beautiful to process.</p>

                <p>Seven days on a houseboat. Seven days of noon chai, walnut-studded pastries, and views that made
                    every Swiss alpine panorama I'd seen feel like a rehearsal.</p>

                <h2>Life on Dal Lake</h2>
                <p>Living on a houseboat is a surreal experience. You wake up to the gentle rocking of water, draw back
                    hand-carved wooden shutters, and see the Zabarwan mountains reflected in the lake. The flower
                    sellers paddle by at dawn. The vegetable vendors come later. By evening, the lake turns gold and you
                    understand why emperors fought for this place.</p>

                <h2>The Mughal Gardens</h2>
                <p>Shalimar Bagh, Nishat Bagh, Chashmeshahi — the Mughal gardens are geometry made beautiful. Terraced
                    lawns, cascading fountains, chinar trees that have been standing since the 17th century. After two
                    years of Scandinavian minimalism, the ornate excess of Mughal design felt like coming home to a
                    language I'd forgotten I spoke.</p>

                <h2>Kashmiri Wazwan</h2>
                <p>Wazwan is not a meal — it's a ceremony. Seven dishes minimum, often more, each one slow-cooked and
                    layered with spices that your European friends have never heard of. Rogan josh that actually tastes
                    the way rogan josh is supposed to taste. Gushtaba — meatballs in yoghurt so smooth it's practically
                    velvet. This is food that reminds you what you've been missing.</p>
