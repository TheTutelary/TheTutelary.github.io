            <div class="article-content">
                <p>Most people visit Goa in winter, when the sky is clear and the beaches are packed. I came back in
                    July — monsoon season — and found an entirely different place. The tourist shacks were shuttered,
                    the beaches were empty, and the sky was the kind of dramatic grey that makes photographers lose
                    their minds.</p>

                <p>This was my second Goa trip, and the contrast with December couldn't be sharper. Monsoon Goa is raw,
                    green, and deeply atmospheric. It's Goa for people who want to feel the place rather than party in
                    it.</p>

                <h2>The Green Transformation</h2>
                <p>Everything is green. Not the polite green of European parks — the aggressive, tropical,
                    every-surface-colonized green of a monsoon landscape. The Dudhsagar waterfall is at full force, the
                    spice plantations are bursting, and the paddy fields glow like someone spilled emerald paint across
                    the countryside.</p>

                <h2>Empty Beaches</h2>
                <p>Walking on Colva Beach in the rain, completely alone except for a few fishermen, felt
                    post-apocalyptic in the best way. The Arabian Sea in monsoon is angry and alive — waves crashing
                    with a violence that demands respect. You don't swim; you watch. And it's magnificent.</p>

                <h2>Seafood Season</h2>
                <p>Contrary to tourist logic, monsoon is actually peak freshness for seafood. The fishing boats go out
                    between storms and come back with mackerel, pomfret, and prawns that taste like the sea
                    concentrated. A fish thali at a local place in Panjim cost 150 rupees and was one of the best meals
                    of my year.</p>
