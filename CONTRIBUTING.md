How to add a New Trip

Prepare your images: Save your photos in /assets/images/ using lowercase names (e.g., paris-trip-1.jpg).

Create the post:

Go to the /posts/ folder.

Copy template.html and rename it (e.g., tokyo-trip.html).

Update the title, h1, and content sections.

Link it on the Home Page:

Open index.html.

Add a new <article> card in the post-grid section pointing to your new file.

Quality Standards

Use Semantic HTML (tags like <article>, <section>, <nav>).

All images must have an alt attribute for accessibility.

Keep CSS styles in assets/css/style.css.

Bug Reports

If you find a broken link or a layout issue, please open a GitHub Issue with a description of the problem.
